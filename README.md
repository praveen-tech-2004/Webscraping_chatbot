# Webscraping_chatbot
This project demonstrates the use of web scraping, text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity to build a simple retrieval-based chatbot. The bot can understand user inputs to some extent and respond with relevant sentences from the scraped text, providing a basis for more advanced conversational agents.
