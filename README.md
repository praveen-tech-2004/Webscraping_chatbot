Project Description: Retrieval Learning Bot
Overview:
The Retrieval Learning Bot is a simple chatbot designed to simulate conversation with users by retrieving and responding with the most contextually relevant sentences from a given corpus of text. The project uses web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques to achieve this.

Key Components:

1. Web Scraping:
   - Libraries Used: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`
   - Functionality: Fetches and parses content from a specified URL. The HTML content is then cleaned and converted to plain text.

2. Text Preprocessing:
   - Libraries Used: `nltk`, `re`
   - Functionality: 
     - Tokenizes the text into sentences and words.
     - Lemmatizes words to their base forms.
     - Removes punctuation and converts text to lowercase.
     - Handles stopwords to improve text processing efficiency.

   TF-IDF Vectorization:
   - Libraries Used: `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`
   - Functionality:Converts the corpus of text into a TF-IDF matrix, which quantifies the importance of each word in each document relative to the entire corpus.

4. Cosine Similarity:
   - Libraries Used:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity`
   - Functionality: Measures the cosine similarity between the user input and the sentences in the corpus to identify the most contextually relevant response.

5. Greeting Mechanism:
   - Functionality: Recognizes and responds to simple greetings from the user using predefined sets of greetings and responses.

6. Response Generation:
   - Functionality:
     - Appends user input to the corpus.
     - Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to find the sentence in the corpus that is most similar to the user input.
     - Returns this sentence as the chatbotâ€™s response.

7. Chatbot Interaction Loop:
   - Functionality:
     - Continuously interacts with the user until the user decides to end the conversation.
     - Handles user inputs for greetings, acknowledgments, and general queries.


Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of web scraping, text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity to build a simple retrieval-based chatbot. The bot can understand user inputs to some extent and respond with relevant sentences from the scraped text, providing a basis for more advanced conversational agents.
